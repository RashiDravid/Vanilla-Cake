Now add the milk little by little to the mixture while mixing

Butter your pan and pour your cake batter in it.

Bake the cakes for 30 to 35 minutes.

Check if the cake is done or not by inserting the toothpick in the cake if it comes out clean it's done if not it could use 2 to 3 minutes in the oven.
